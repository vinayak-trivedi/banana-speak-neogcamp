            <p class="fact-paragraph">Apart from the hurried stream of words that Minions speak, some words stand out from the others—particularly the word Minions love to say—<strong>“banana!”</strong>. This word has been spoken so frequently that Minionese is often referred to as “banana language”. When Minions say “banana”, they mean the banana fruit but there are plenty of other food words in their vocabularies such as the song featuring banana and potato, and the words “poulet tiki masala”; poulet means chicken in French while tikka masala is a spicy Indian chicken dish. They count 1,2,3 in the Korean language and say thank you as “Tank Yu”. Another food word such as ice cream is spoken as “gelato” in Minion.</p>
